This is a small practice utility for [A Short Hike](http://ashorthike.com/).

### Features
- position and speed of the player
- analysis of the last flight
- current state of the character (climbing, gliding, â€¦)

### Requirements

This was tested for the Steam version 4.2 of the game on Windows. It may not work for other versions, and certainly not on other platforms.
This is a C# executable that requires the [.NET runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) to be installed.

### Installation

Get the zip archive from the release page, extract the files somewhere and launch the executable. When the game is open, click the "attach" button.
